Talent Developers - Onboarding Task 
Introduction: 
Welcome! The Talent Onboarding Task is designed to familiarise you with technologies that you will be utilising once you join the project team. While the instructions tell you what to do, they do not always necessarily tell you how to do it. This is deliberate as it is important for you to develop an independent drive to solve problems on your own. You are not allowed to ask your tutors or senior interns in MVP studios for help at this stage. You are allowed to discuss with other interns in your intake while working on the task.
Warning:
There are a couple of ways to install React. If you are reading other tutorials on React, then be aware that the things taught in the tutorial might not be used in the onboarding task. For example, react routing might not using in the onboarding task. Also, following online tutorials and installing specific versions of npm packages might cause conflicts between different package versions.
